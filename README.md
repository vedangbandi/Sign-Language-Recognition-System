# Sign Language Recognition System  

The **Sign Language Recognition System** is a Python-based solution aimed at bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities. This system leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning technologies to recognize and translate sign language gestures, including alphabets (A-Z), into text in real time.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Detects and classifies gestures and alphabets with an impressive accuracy of 95%.  
- **Alphabet Recognition**: Supports recognition of A-Z gestures for enhanced communication.  
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Easily adaptable to recognize additional gestures and regional sign languages.  
- **Accessible Design**: Built for seamless use with a webcam and user-friendly interface.  
- **Open Source**: Available for further development and enhancements.

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection**: Real-time video feed is captured via a webcam.  
2. **Gesture Detection**: MediaPipe identifies hand landmarks, and the data is preprocessed for analysis.  
3. **Model Classification**: A pre-trained TensorFlow model predicts the gesture or alphabet.  
4. **Output Display**: The recognized gesture or alphabet is displayed as text in the application.

## 📖 Key Technologies  
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.  
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and preprocessing.  
- **MediaPipe**: Detects hand landmarks and tracks gestures.  
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Powers the deep learning model for gesture classification.  
- **NumPy**: Handles numerical operations and data preprocessing.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Accurately detects and interprets hand gestures using a webcam.  
- **High Accuracy**: Recognizes 10 basic gestures with a 95% success rate.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless interaction for users of all skill levels.  
- **Customizable & Scalable**: Supports future updates for additional gestures and sign languages.  
- **Open Source**: Available for further development and customization.

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Input via Webcam**: The system captures video input of hand gestures in real time.  
2. **Gesture Detection**: Using **MediaPipe**, it identifies hand landmarks and preprocesses the data.  
3. **Classification**: A pre-trained TensorFlow deep learning model classifies the gesture into predefined categories.  
4. **Output**: The recognized gesture is displayed as text on the screen.
